# AOGF

AOGF (Archived Object Graph Format) is a binary data-interchange format. It differs from formats such as JSON and MessagePack in that it is able to represent *arbitrary* object graphs, including those containing cycles or multiple instances of the same object, without duplication.

Read the [specification](spec.md).

This project is currently in early stages and the specification may contain errors or inconsistencies, and is not ready for implementation.
